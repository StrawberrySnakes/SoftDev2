Unit 05 Practice Problems

The goal of these "mini practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gauge your preparedness for the exams.

You should create all of your required files in the practicum folder.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. 
=======================================================

1. Open the uml.png file provided in the unit06.practicum package and 
review the UML diagram.
 
2. Create a generic interface named Stack<E> using the diagram as a guide.

3. Create an array-based implementation, ArrayStack<E>, of the Stack. 

   Each time you create a new method you should test it manually in main. 

   Use the UML diagram in uml.png as a guide where:
        - size() returns the number of elements in a stack.
        - top() returns the value of the top element in the stack.
        - push() adds a value to the top of the stack.
        - pop() removes and returns the value at the top of the stack.
        - toString() returns the elements in the stack formatted as 
          "[<top value>, <next value>, â€¦, <bottom value>]"

4. Make the Stack<E> iterable by extending the Iterable<E> interface.

5. Use the ArrayIterator class provided in the practicum folder to 
   implement the iterator method in ArrayStack. Test that it works by using 
   an ArrayStack in a for each loop.

6. The final UML is provided in the referece.png file as a reference. You 
   do not need to use it but you may find it useful as a guide for parts 4 and 
   5.
