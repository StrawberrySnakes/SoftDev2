1. What state will your configuration need to keep track of as it attempts 
    to find a solution?
   
   The configuration will need to keep track of the current state of the PetesPike game, including the positions of Pete,
    the goats, and the mountain. Additionally, it should maintain a list of moves made so far to reach the current state.

2. How will you make successor configurations?
   
   Successor configurations will be generated by applying all possible valid moves to the current configuration. 
   These moves can include moving Pete or any of the goats horizontally or vertically.

3. How will you determine if a configuration is invalid?
   
   A configuration will be considered invalid if it violates any of the game rules. For example, 
   if Pete or a goat is moved off the grid, or if a goat is moved into a position already occupied by another goat,
    the configuration is invalid.

4. How will you determine if the configuration is the goal?
   
   The configuration will be considered the goal if Pete is positioned on the space designated as the mountaintop.

5. Do you need to be concerned with cycles? If so, how will you avoid them?
   
   Yes, cycles need to be avoided to prevent the backtracker from getting stuck in an infinite loop. 
   To avoid cycles, the backtracker should keep track of visited configurations and ensure that it does not revisit
    a configuration that has already been explored. This can be achieved by using a set or hash table to store
     visited configurations and checking against it before generating successor configurations.
