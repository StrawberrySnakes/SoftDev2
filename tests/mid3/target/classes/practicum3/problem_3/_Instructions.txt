Given a list of integers and an empty list, divide the integers between the two
lists such that the sum of the two lists are equal.
For example,
    Given: [3,9,4,3,1] []
    A Solution: [3,4,3] [9,1]

You have been provided a partial backtracking configuration in
SplitEqualSum.java.  You are to implement the following backtracker
configuration methods to solve the problem or determine no solution exists:
    getSuccessors()
    isValid()
    isGoal()
    toString()
        format is <sum list 1><list 1> <sum list 2><list 2>
        Example: 10[3, 4, 3] 10[9, 1]

For a valid solution, neither list can be empty.  For example,
[0] [] is not a valid solution.

You may add attributes or methods as needed.

Hint: Lists have a copy constructor, for example
    List<Integer> listCopy = new ArrayList<>(list);
Hint: For getSuccessors() use a loop to move numbers
one at a time from the first list to the second list

A main has been provided for manual testing and debugging.  A more comprehensive
test suite has been provided in SplitEqualSumTest.java
