Spend a few minutes examining the TempConverter interface that 
has been provided for you. It is a functional interface that defines a
single method meant to convert temperatures from one scale to another. For
example, one possible implementation would convert from degrees Celsius to
degrees Fahrenheit, e.g. 10.5 C -> 50.9 F.

The formulae for converting between scales are as follows:

C to F: C * 9/5 + 32 
F to C: (F - 32) * 5/9
F to K: (F - 32) * 5/9 + 273.15 
K to F: (K - 273.15) * 9/5 + 32

Fill out the Converter class with the following:
- Define a public static inner class that converts from C to F
- Define a public static variable "inner" which references an instance of the above inner class
- Define a public static variable "anonymous" which uses an anonymous class to convert from F to C
- Define a public static variable "lambda" which uses an lambda to convert from F to K
- Define a public static method in Converter which converts from K to F
- Define a public static variable "methodref" which provides a method reference to the K to F method
