Unit 04 Practice Problems

The goal of these "mini practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gauge your preparedness for the exams.

You should create all of your required files in this folder along with these
instructions.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. 
======================

1. You have been provided with code that implements a high-low model and a 
   simple GUI. If you have not done so already, familiarize yourself with the 
   following classes and interfaces:
   - unit05.hilo.model.HiLo 
   - unit05.hilo.model.HiLoObserver
   - unit05.hilo.view.HiLoGUI


2. When you run HiLoGUI, the game board should be displayed (see hilo01.png).


3. Your task is to complete the provided code so that if the user enters a 
   number in the text field, the GUI is updated as follows:
   a. The first row (a text field) should be cleared so that the user can enter
      the next guess.
   b. The second row (a label) should display one of the following messages 
      (where <guess> is the number that was guessed): 
      - <guess> is too high! 
      - <guess> is too low!
      - <guess> is correct. You won!
      - You lost! The secret number was <secret number>
   c. The third row (a label) should display the number of available guesses 
      (see hilo02.png).
